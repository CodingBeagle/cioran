# Descriptors

A descriptor is an object that provides a way for shaders to access various types of resources such as buffers, images, and samplers.

Descriptors are used to bind these resources to a pipeline, enabling shaders to read or write data.

*Descriptor Sets* are a collection of descriptors that can be bound to a pipeline.
