# Textures

- Texels
    - Texture Element.
    - A texel is the smallest unit of texture data, analogous to a pixel in an image.
    - A texel represents a single data point in a texture, which can contain color, depth, or other information.
- Texel Blocks
    - Texel blocks are groups of multiple texels stored together in a block.
    - Texel blocks are usually used in compression schemes to improve memory effiency.
